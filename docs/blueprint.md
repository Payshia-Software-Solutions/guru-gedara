## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very pale yellow (#FDF5E6) to complement the primary color and create a warm, inviting atmosphere.
- Accent color: Earthy orange (#D2691E) to complement the overall color palette. Can be used in buttons and interactive elements to add warmth.
- Body and Headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for clear, readable text in both Sinhala and English. Code Font: 'Source Code Pro'.
- Use subject-specific icons, such as a microscope for Science and a computer for ICT. Ensure these icons are modern, flat designs that complement the overall style. Icons can be slightly animated upon hover or click.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure a structured, clean, and responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations such as fade-ins and transitions to improve user experience without overwhelming the interface. Use animations sparingly, mainly for feedback on user interactions.
